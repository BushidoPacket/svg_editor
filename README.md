# Java Swing SVG Editor / Drawing

This was a college assignment to create drawing using Java GUI Swing in programming classes.

All libraries are already included in lib folder, no need to download anything more to run this project.

The requirements were to create drawing with Java Swing to be also editable, exportable and importable in SVG/XML code + exportable in JSON structure.

I added a few not required functions like the checker of actual settings, better SVG parser and formatter or a few different settings with option to delete entire work.

*This project has been created on first attempt without some previous planning so some things might seem confusing. Code is readable and important parts are commented, however, there are definitely parts that are made in a bit different style than other parts or created in not so effective code. That being put into perspective that I am not a Java Swing fan, I had to search for a lot of informations and just tried to make it as fast and effective as possible. So, it's possible for many parts there exists a better solution.*
